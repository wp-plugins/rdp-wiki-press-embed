RDP Google Custom Search lets you use Google's Custom Search Engine (CSE) API to add targeted search capability to your site.

== Description ==
**ATTN: This plugin only works with the PAID version of Google Custom Search.**

With RDP Google Custom Search, you can target your site's contents, or other site's contents. You can add multiple CSEs and allow your visitor to choose one.

RDP Google Custom Search uses a simple shortcode so that a search box can be placed anywhere.

You can put a multi-CSE search box in the main content of your page, and then put another search box in the sidebar that is dedicated to only one CSE, such as your site.

Each search box also provides a **Page** selector, which will search the current page and highlight matching text.

The results are displayed using a special template that replaces the content of the current page/post and that can be styled as desired. The default width of the results content is 980px. The built-in rendering function marks up the results to use Google styling HTML and class names.

This plugin can be used with the RDP inGroups+ and RDP Wiki-Press Embed plugins, which allow you to have the links in the search results that point to the following locations to postback and display content on your own web site:

* LinkedIn Group
* Individual LinkedIn Group discussion
* MediaWiki pages, such as those found on WikiPedia

== Usage ==

RDP Google Custom Search is implemented using the shortcode [rdp-gcs]. It accepts the following arguments:

* id: (required) comma separated list of id numbers, indicating the CSEs to use
* default: when more than one CSE is selected, this indicates the CSE to use by default

Examples:

[rdp-gcs id='3']

[rdp-gcs id='1,3' default='1']


== Installation ==

1. Upload `rdp-google-custom-search` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
