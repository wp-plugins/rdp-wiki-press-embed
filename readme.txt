RDP Wiki-Press Embed lets you embed Media Wiki pages in to your site, from sites like Wikipedia, and PediaPress book pages.

== Description ==

RDP Wiki-Press Embed will pull content from any Media Wiki website (such as wikipedia.org) and from PediaPress.
It strips and reformats the content, allowing you to supply some arguments to dictate how this works.

RDP Wiki-Press Embed also allows lead capture capabilities, utilizing free PediaPress ebooks as an offer.

Forked from: [Wiki Embed plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wiki-embed/  "Wiki Embed plugin").

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Could you use this to replicate the whole of Wikipedia = 

Maybe, but why would you want to? That is not what the tool was designed to do. 


== Usage ==

RDP Wiki-Press Embed is implemented using the shortcode [wiki-embed]. It accepts the following arguments:

* url: (required) the web address of the wiki article that you want to embed on this page.
* no-edit: Hide the "edit" links from the wiki.
* no-contents: Hide the page's contents box.
* no-infobox: Hide any infobox that appears on the wiki for this page.
* tabs: Replaces the sections of the wiki article with tabs.
* accordion: Replaces the sections of the wiki article with an accordion. This option cannot be used as the same time as 'tabs'.

Example:
[wiki-embed url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Example" no-edit no-contents no-infobox accordion]


For embedding PediaPress book pages, the following arguments are accepted:

* url: (required) the web address of the PediaPress book that you want to embed on this page.
* toc_show: 0 (zero) to hide table of contents (TOC) or 1 to show TOC
* toc_links: Default — TOC links are enabled; Logged-in — TOC links are active only when a user is logged in; Disabled — TOC links are completely disabled, all the time
* download_button_text: text for call-to-action button
* download_button_width: integer indicating pixel width of call-to-action button; default is 250; max is 500
* download_button_top_color: gradient top color
* download_button_bottom_color: gradient bottom color
* download_button_font_color: normal button text color
* download_button_font_hover_color: text color when cursor is on the button
* download_button_border_color: button border color
* download_button_box_shadow_color: button's drop shadow color
* download_button_text_shadow_color: drop shadow color of button's text

For the download button settings to take affect, the shortcode must be an enclosing shortcode, containing text, HTML, and/or another shortcode between the opening and closing shortcode tags.
